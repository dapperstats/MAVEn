# MAVEn: A Worflow Pipeline for Processing MAVEn Datasets

This repository holds the code being developed for Providence College (PC) and James S. Waters, coded by Megan L. Larsen & Juniper L. Simonis of DAPPER Stats. 

The repository is private and code is not to be shared ouutside of this collaboration.

The 'MAVEn' package provides a current working version of the code pipeline.

The code relies on data that are confidential and owned by Providence College. Thus, the focal data files are not saved under version control (i.e., it is "git-ignored"). This is done by putting the file in a folder called `data`, and then listing the folder in the `.gitignore` file. In order to execute the code, the user must have the `data` directory with the file locally. 

Additional, intermidate data files that need to be "git-ignored" might be generated in the future. Any such files will be kept in the `data` folder, and  thus "git-ignored".
